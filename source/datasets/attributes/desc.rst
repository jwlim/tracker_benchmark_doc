.. |Desc000| replace:: Illumination Variation - the illumination in the target region is significantly changed.
.. |Desc001| replace:: Scale Variation - the ratio of the bounding boxes of the first frame and the current frame is out of the range ts, ts > 1 (ts=2).
.. |Desc002| replace:: Occlusion - the target is partially or fully occluded.
.. |Desc003| replace:: Deformation - non-rigid object deformation.
.. |Desc004| replace:: Motion Blur - the target region is blurred due to the motion of target or camera.
.. |Desc005| replace:: Fast Motion - the motion of the ground truth is larger than tm pixels (tm=20).
.. |Desc006| replace:: In-Plane Rotation - the target rotates in the image plane.
.. |Desc007| replace:: Out-of-Plane Rotation - the target rotates out of the image plane.
.. |Desc008| replace:: Out-of-View - some portion of the target leaves the view.
.. |Desc009| replace:: Background Clutters - the background near the target has the similar color or texture as the target.
.. |Desc010| replace:: Low Resolution - the number of pixels inside the ground-truth bounding box is less than tr (tr =400).
