**Benchmark Results**
*********************

SRER evaluation results on the TB-50 dataset. Each entry contains the average overlap in percent and the average number of failures in 1000 frames at the overlap threshold 0.5. The trackers are ordered by the average overlap scores, and the top 5 methods in each attribute are denoted by different colors: red, green, blue, cyan, and magenta.
